        <summary>About NovaWear</summary>
        <div class="content">
            NovaWear is a clothing brand established in 1984, recognized for its focus on innovative streetwear and
            functional fashion. The brand was founded by Nikola Tesla, whose creative interests extended beyond
            engineering and electricity into design, culture, and human innovation. Tesla believed that clothing could
            act as a bridge between aesthetic (related to beauty or visual appeal) creativity and utilitarian
            (practical, useful) purpose, which shaped the early identity of NovaWear.

            In the late 1980s, NovaWear became known for experimental textiles, bold silhouettes, and futuristic visual
            themes. The brand embraced an avant-garde (new, unusual, experimental) style, incorporating sharp lines,
            metallic tones, and minimalistic design. While NovaWear did not dominate mainstream fashion during this
            period, it developed a loyal underground following—especially among artists, designers, and youth
            countercultures who appreciated unconventional ideas.

            Following Tesla’s death, NovaWear changed ownership several times, struggling at moments with inconsistent
            branding and limited global direction. Despite these challenges, the company preserved elements of its
            original philosophy: pushing boundaries, encouraging individuality, and experimenting with design as a form
            of expression.

            A major turning point occurred when Rafay became the owner of NovaWear. Under his leadership, the brand
            shifted toward modernization, sustainability, and cultural relevance. Sustainability (ability to continue
            without harming the environment) is now a core value expressed through eco-friendly materials, ethical
            manufacturing, and reduced waste. NovaWear also incorporated tech-driven textiles—such as breathable,
            moisture-wicking, and climate-adaptive fabrics—to improve comfort, performance, and durability.

            In terms of brand identity, NovaWear emphasizes innovation, self-expression, and urban functionality. The
            brand positions itself as a creative platform for individuals who value both fashion and responsible
            consumption. Rafay introduced contemporary influences from global streetwear, digital culture, music, and
            art, helping re-shape the brand's aesthetics for a new generation.

            Marketing efforts are built around limited drops, influencer partnerships, and storytelling through digital
            media. This strategy builds exclusivity (rare, limited access) and creates cultural momentum, especially
            among younger audiences who respond to identity-driven fashion. Collaborations with musicians, graphic
            artists, and content creators have reinforced NovaWear’s image as a brand connected to modern culture and
            youth identity.

            Today, NovaWear continues to evolve while staying committed to innovation and sustainable design. Though its
            direction has shifted since 1984, the brand maintains a legacy of creativity rooted in Tesla’s vision and
            strengthened by Rafay’s leadership, reflecting a blend of past inspiration and future ambition
